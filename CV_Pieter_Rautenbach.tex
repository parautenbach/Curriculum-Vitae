\cvsection{Professional Career}
\cvsubsection{Profile}

I am a technologist and engineer by trade, with an appreciation for science. I have 
an affinity for people and what matters to them, with a need to work in a trusting, open 
and collaborative environment. 

I am intrinsically motivated and have solid analytical and mentoring skills. I value integrity. 
I enjoy solving problems while finding a balance between what the business or customer 
needs vs. implementing a sustainable solution. 

I have managed several teams and successfully delivered projects over more than 20 years
using pragmatic agile principles. I have a passion for process and system automation, and 
software quality. I have significant experience in these areas and drive this with every team 
that I've been involved with or lead. 

My technical domain knowledge entails the design and implementation of distributed, highly 
concurrent systems as applied in the fields of social media, location-based services, value-added 
services, system integration and retail. I know a variety of programming languages and modern 
technologies. Besides software architecture, I'm also well versed in business analysis and 
business process modelling. I have contributed to start-ups three times, experienced a major sale 
of shares and an acquisition, while being on the due diligence team on both occasions. 

Besides my experience in software development, operations and product management, I have 
a passion for data analytics, as supported by my qualifications in digital signal processing and 
machine learning. 

I believe it is important to engage with the ICT community on a regular basis and for that reason 
I have participated by means of presentations, interviews and articles. 

Living a balanced life is vital to me. I value spending time with friends and family. I compete in 
mountain biking and running. My love for music allows me to escape from work in order to 
revitalise. I play the piano, among other instruments, and enjoy on-stage performances for 
a cappella singing.
