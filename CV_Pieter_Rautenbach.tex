\cvsubsection{\color{subheading}Profile}
\cvsubsubsection{\color{subheading}Technologist and Engineer | Leader with Over 20+ Years of Experience}

I am a seasoned technologist with an appreciation for science and a passion for
solving complex problems. With over 20 years of experience, I have successfully managed
teams and delivered impactful projects by applying pragmatic agile principles and
fostering open, collaborative environments built on trust and integrity, and driving
continuous improvement across every initiative.

My expertise spans designing and implementing distributed, highly concurrent systems
across industries such as machine learning, e-commerce, social media, and
location-based services. I am proficient in a variety of modern programming languages
and technologies, blending technical depth with strong analytical, mentoring, and
leadership skills.

Beyond software architecture, I bring significant experience in business analysis,
process optimisation, and system automation, driven by my passion for software quality,
data analytics and ongoing iterative improvements. My qualifications in digital signal
processing and machine learning complement my technical background, allowing me to
deliver sustainable, data-driven solutions for both businesses and customers.

I’ve contributed to three start-ups, navigating major milestones like share sales and
acquisitions, including participation in due diligence teams. As an active member of the
ICT community, I’ve offered insights through presentations, interviews, and published
articles to help advance industry practices.

Living a balanced life is essential to me. I thrive on personal growth through mountain
biking, running, and music. Whether performing on stage with a cappella groups, playing
the piano, or racing my mountain bike, my love for music and sports allows me to recharge
and remain inspired for the challenges ahead.

% I am a technologist and engineer by trade, with an appreciation for science. I have
% an affinity for people and what matters to them. I need to work in a trusting, open
% and collaborative environment.

% I am intrinsically motivated and have solid analytical and mentoring skills. I value integrity.
% I enjoy solving problems while finding a balance between what the business or customer
% needs vs. implementing a sustainable solution.

% I have managed several teams and successfully delivered projects over more than 20 years
% using pragmatic agile principles. I have a passion for process and system automation, and
% software quality. I have significant experience in these areas and drive this with every team
% that I've been involved with or lead.

% My technical domain knowledge entails the design and implementation of distributed, highly
% concurrent systems as applied in the fields of social media, location-based services, value-added
% services, system integration and e-commerce. I know a variety of programming languages and modern
% technologies. Besides software architecture, I'm also well versed in business analysis and
% business process modelling. I have contributed to start-ups three times, experienced a major sale
% of shares and an acquisition, while being on the due diligence team on both occasions.

% Besides my experience in software development, operations and product management, I have
% a passion for data analytics, as supported by my qualifications in digital signal processing and
% machine learning.

% I believe it is important to engage with the ICT community on a regular basis and for that reason
% I have participated by means of presentations, interviews and articles.

% Living a balanced life is vital to me. I value spending time with friends and family. I compete in
% mountain biking and running. My love for music allows me to escape from work in order to
% revitalise. I play the piano, among other instruments, and enjoy on-stage performances for
% a cappella singing.
